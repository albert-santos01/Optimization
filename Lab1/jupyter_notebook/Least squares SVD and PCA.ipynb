This is the first script of the face recognition application. The idea here is to run a very simple face recognition algorithm, but using PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the vectors. The original vectors are images of 211 x 229. If we consider the images as vectors in IR^n (each pixel is a component of the vector), we have that n = 221x229 = 48319. Using PCA, we will reduce the dimensionality to ~ 50, 1000 times smaller!!!"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"pH5hqZilbvPW"},"outputs":[],"source":["# In case needed:\n","#!conda install -c anaconda pillow -y"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"y_8GyL2fbvPW"},"outputs":[],"source":["from PIL import Image\n","import os"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wB4fYFpsbvPX"},"source":["**1) Load faces from image files** \n","\n","Images are in data/faces folder.
